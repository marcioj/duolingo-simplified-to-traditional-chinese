# Duolingo Simplified to Traditional Chinese

### Installing

First you'll need to pull down the development version

```sh
git clone https://github.com/marcioj/duolingo-simplified-to-traditional-chinese.git
cd duolingo-simplified-to-traditional-chinese
yarn install
```

Then in Chrome go to **More Tools** => **Extensions**, click **Developer mode** then **Load unpacked extension** then add the project root

After that run `yarn start`, any changes you make will automatically be saved will build the project, but you'll need to refresh the extension for Chrome to load the changes.
